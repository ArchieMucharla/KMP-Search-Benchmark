`What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:`


We had a lot of midterms this week, so we didn't make any progress on implemeting our KMP algorithm.
However, we met up and made sure we understood Professor Soloman's feedback. In addition, we reviewed the project requirements.

We didn't encounter any issues that prevented us from our goals this week.

Next week, we will be implementing our codebase. We will first start with preprocess_pattern(), and then KMP_search(). In addition, we will improve our test cases based on Professor Soloman's feedback.
