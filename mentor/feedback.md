# Mentor Feedback


## Week 1: 11/06 - 11/12
Thanks for the update. Hope midterms went well! We suggest you begin implementation as soon as possible. I would aim to complete all preprocessing and the bulk of the KMP algorithm during this week before break so you have concrete results to show at the midpoint meeting. As a reminder, you need to have a *working* algorithm to show at the midpoint checkin, as well as tests to prove it. Looking forward to seeing your progress, and let us know if we can provide you any guidance along the way!
