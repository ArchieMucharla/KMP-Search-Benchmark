# Mentor Feedback


## Week 1: 11/06 - 11/12
Thanks for the update. Hope midterms went well! We suggest you begin implementation as soon as possible. I would aim to complete all preprocessing and the bulk of the KMP algorithm during this week before break so you have concrete results to show at the midpoint meeting. As a reminder, you need to have a *working* algorithm to show at the midpoint checkin, as well as tests to prove it. Looking forward to seeing your progress, and let us know if we can provide you any guidance along the way!

## Week 2: 11/13 - 11/19
Great job on your progress! It's common to face challenges while setting up the development environment with cmake, but I'm glad you guys figured it out. Focusing on improving test cases for the upcoming week is a good idea. We can provide you more feedback at the midpoint meeting tonight.

Regarding benchmarking Big-O, we recommend using measuring execution time (you can just use any tool or function within c++). I would also run the algorithm with different input sizes to see how execution time scales with different input complexities, so you can maybe find a runtime pattern.
