Week of 11/19 to 11/26:

What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
- Implement functional codebase: Accomplished, was able to set up codebase using cmake
- Start preprocess_pattern(): Accomplished, we just need to add additional test cases for a comprehensive test suite.
- KMP_search(): Accomplished, we just need to add additional test cases using our other datasets for a comprehensive test suite.

What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week:
- Archie worked on preprocessing function
- Simone worked on KMP search function
- Archie added test cases
- Simone added naive search function and added comparison counter for KMP search

What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
- We had a hard time setting up the development environment with catch2 and make, but thankfully we were able to get it working.

What you plan to accomplish next week:
- Improve our test cases: we will add more test cases, especially using different complexities of patterns
- Begin written report

Questions for mid-week check-in:
- Can we benchmark Big O with the comparison counter, or should we time our algorithm in another way?
