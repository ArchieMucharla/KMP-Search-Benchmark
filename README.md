# CS 225 EC Project Summary
Our proposed project is to implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm for finding occurrences of a string pattern within a larger string.

# Code
If our project is approved, we will create a `code/ ` folder and provide all of our implemented files in there. We will also provide details on how to run the code.

# Data
