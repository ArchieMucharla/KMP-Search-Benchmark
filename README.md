# Running Instructions

Running Instructions â€“ You should provide full instructions on how to build and run your executable, including how to define the input data and output location for each method. You should also have instructions on how to build and run your test suite. It is in your best interest to make the instructions (and the running of your executables and tests) as simple and straightforward as possible.
